### Welcome to our github pages

### Game name:

### Basic information
The main mission is to fly around the world to delivery goods. You have to start the game with ultralight plane. Furthermore, you have no money at start but you can still fly from airfield to next. Therefore, you haul some cargo from airfield to next to gather some cash to buy better planes and achieve your goal of flying around the world, eventually. This is an arcade game. 

The unique of the game is (I have no idea(Toni)). Consequently, the main thing in this game are the plane, goods, map, and weather, Thunderbirds and Pelicans carrying sticks of dynamite, of which they try to drop on you, Lightning bolts (hurled by Zeus), gusts of winds. Winds have directions and it might pull you down or up. You must counter this by flying in parallel to wind. Sometimes there is a very strong wind player must avoid or his/her plane starts to broke. Going too high will eventually reduce gravity and then you just float off to vast nothingness of space. Going to low means stalling and crashing to earth. There could also be invisible air bumps that will make your plane fly erratically.

Planes can eventually carry guns shoot birds. Pew Pew. However, if air police sees you shooting protected birds, you will get nasty penalty.
